A tree identical to the one in the room you just left now sits in the hallway.
You can feel the floor rumbling from beneath you.
Suddenly, lightning shoots out from each of the tree's limbs.
You can hear a loud, raspy scream echoing throughout the hall.
The floor beneath you suddenly collapses, and you fall into a vast nothingness.
